HW Subsission - SQL Challenge

1) Please review QuickDBD-export for ERD image

2) Please review "sql-challenge_tableSchema.sql" for cleaner version of table schemata. 
I did not initially save my "create table" queries, so I basically recreated the code along with my code to assign/create primary keys.
Please refer to "sql_challenge_schema.sql" if anything appears to be missing from the cleaner file, as this is an actual
"backup" of the database (less the imported data).

3) Please review "sql_challenge_queries.sql" for the 8 queries

4) Please review "sql_bonus.ipnyb" for bonus questions.

I gave emp_no a datatype of varchar because dept_no had letters, but it could be bigint instead.
"dep_no" in the manager table should really be "dept_no", to be consistent with the other tables (not required, but would be preferred).
